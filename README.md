# Turing Machine Playground
This project is an emulator to play with and visualise turing machines written in Kotlin.
It displays tape in the console as each m-configuration is processed.
The project includes example machines from Turing's Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine as reported by the Charles Petzold book *The Annotated Turing*.
## How it works
It abstracts the definitions for each machine's m-configurations from the generic Turing Machine class which defines the tape and operations: *left*, *right*, *print* and *erase*.
